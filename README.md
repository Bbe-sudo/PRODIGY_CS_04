# PRODIGY_CS_04
Cyber Security Internship Task 4 – Prodigy InfoTech

## Task Overview
Develop a packet sniffer tool that captures and analyzes network packets. The tool displays information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol, ports, packet length and a small preview of payload data. The tool is intended for educational and defensive use only — run it only on networks you own or have explicit permission to test.

## Features
- Encrypts and decrypts both uppercase and lowercase letters  
- Leaves spaces and non-alphabetic characters unchanged  
- Simple text-based user interface  

## Tools Used
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **IDE/Editor:** VS Code

What I Learned
- Packet structure basics: Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP headers and payload separation.
- How to use scapy to parse and inspect packets and how to apply BPF filters to limit capture.
- Practical considerations: root/admin privileges, OS-specific capture drivers (Npcap), and ethics/privacy concerns.
